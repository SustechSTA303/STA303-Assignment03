## Assignment3: Find the shortest path in underground lines 
### File Description
- Run All-formal.py to play path length calculation of the four chosen algorithms, A*, Dijkstra's, UCS, Greedy, and Bidirectional A*. The station pairs testing them are 20 randomly choosen pairs. This program will output a file named output.txt, recording the outputs.
- Those single files like Greedy.py, A*-Auto.py performs path plot. Your can change the station pairs in the __main__ of the files. It will then run automatically. Vistualize the plot though my_shortest_path_in_London_railway.html.
- Other functions is unchanged.
- Use Plot.ipynb to plot the figs shown in report.
